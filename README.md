# Lab 26: Frontend Tooling and React with Cowsay Browser   
  
####  Documentation   
* create and render React components to the DOM
* add event listeners to React components 
* update React component state
* utilize [Maps]

#### Stretch Goals
* Add a select menu that enables you to change the type of cowfile currently being used
* Add functionality where clicking a list item deletes that item and updates the state accordingly
* Save your lists and any other relevant state properties to local storage so when you restart your app, that data persists on page reload
* CSS it up! Or more accurately, SCSS it up. [Read SCSS docs](https://sass-lang.com/guide) and make your app look amazing.
